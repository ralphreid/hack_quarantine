# Healthy Queues for Communities Impacted by COVID-19

Enhance and improve Awareness and Behaviour of citizens who need to wait in
Queues and lines. Leverage virtual geo-fences and SMS technologies to enable
folks to be socially distant when needing to access community spaces like parks,
wait in food bank lines and fulfilling civic duties like voting.

## Inspiration:

Daily news reports in the UK & Globally, depict massively long lines of folks
waiting for food distribution and charity locations as well as commercial
stores. Sadly, folks are standing in [hour(s)
long](https://eu.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/09/coronavirus-wisconsin-state-tracking-whether-cases-tied-voting/5126212002/)
lines to cast ballots. In some urban areas, parks and communal spaces are locked
off because communities are not able to acceptable use the area while being
socially distant.

All these cases are important to the fabric of society. We need to continue to
sustain ourselves with healthy foods, participate in civic life & commune with
our natural environments.

It seems a central problem is unsafe queuing. Many cars and people in long lines
increases stress levels. Waiting in lines in in-climate weather or for many
hours on ones feet may deteriorate a persons state of mind as well as increase
risks of COVID transmission.

Technology should be used to help communities better utilise public spaces to
reduce over crowding & help citizens. In many urban centres, people do not have
access to gardens or open spaces. Helping communities to use appropriately use
public spaces like parks supports people's mental health. Additionally, 'healthy
queues' application can flex park usage as government guidance evolves.

## What It Does:

We identified THREE key types of lines requiring improved behaviour. Our
submission focussed on Public Spaces Queues. This just one type of line. We
chose to focus on this type rather voting and shopping lines as it was simpler
to prototype given our team make-up.

When local members of the community want to use a small local park they can got
to health.queues app. Users simply sign-up using their mobile number. Next, the
user indicates the park the they want to visit.

The system will let users know when it a good time to head to the park. This
keeps number of people in the park to a manageable level & helps community
members to maintain socially distance.

If the park is too full with citizen, the system will let users know and suggest
they wait a bit longer to visit the park.

After sometime, the system will contact the citizen to check if they have left
the park. The user can responds via SMS to let the system know that they have
left the park. The system will then let the next person know that its fine to
head to the park since a new space has opened.

## How we Designed & Built It:

Step 1: Formed team & conducted several problem discovery sessions. During
several brainstorm sessions, we identified two key features we would like to
build. The first was the idea of virtual line. The second was the ability to
collect a shopping list from others for a person joining a virtual line. This
second feature improves behaviour since one person could shop on behalf of
others. This was an appealing feature and will be incorporated into the future
'Shopping' queue features.

Step 2: Identify solution boundaries & Options. TODO

Step 3: Designed User Journeys & Mock-ups for Shopping lines in order to better
understand key constraints. TODO

Step 4: Discussed and decided to focus on the most atomic function which were
common for any line time.

Step 5: Identify Technology Components

Step 6: Developed a Prototype of the 'Parks' line type since this has the least
level of complexity.
