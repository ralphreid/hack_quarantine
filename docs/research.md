## Epic:
1. Lines are getting long and unhealthy. Safe lines helps you help others while being a good citizen (using public spaces likes parks, shopping for essentials and voting)
1. I wish I new how long the line is before I left my home (future)

## Stories:
1. Hey, I am in line. I can hold your place if you like. My code name
2. Safe lines allows you to signup on your phone. Gives you a call to check your cool.
1. Safe lines asks you if your waiting in line for food or to vote.
1. If you in line for food, it gives you todo list you can share with your peeps so they can let you know to hunt for an essential item.
1. If you are in line to vote it lets you broadcast (gps ring fenced) that you need a comfort break, 'Can someone hold my place in line?'
1. If your a safe line citizen, lets you volunteer to hold place in line for voters needing a break.
1. If your using your local park for a walk, let others know your there and allow community self manage use to keep usage with a threshold.
